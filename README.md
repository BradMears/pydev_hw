# My python environment for hardware tinkering
This image include the python libraries and utilities that I find useful when working 
with hardware projects in my lab. This is very much tailored to the hardware I own and 
use on a regular basis.

Within this image, I have multiple python virtual environments, one for each type of 
hardware interface. This allows me to keep the python dependencies for one piece of 
hardware separate from the other(s). See bashrc.pydev_hw for how to activate them.
